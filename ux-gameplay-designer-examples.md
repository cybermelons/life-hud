# UX Gameplay Designer - Example Interactions & Test Cases

## Example 1: Lilaya's Kama Battle System Design

### User Request:
"Design a combat system for dealing with destructive thought patterns using CBT principles"

### Agent Response:

```markdown
## Kama Battle: Pattern Transformation Combat

### Core Gameplay Loop
**Primary Action**: Transform klesha (suffering) patterns through manual chain building
- Player identifies problematic NUT as "klesha"
- Selects Kama type (desire category) 
- Builds counter-chain: New Note → New Urge → New Task
- Victory through actual task completion (not just clicking)

### Combat Mechanics (No AI Interpretation)
Player has full agency - they create their own solutions:

#### Phase 1: Pattern Recognition
```
KLESHA DETECTED: [User's logged NUT]
Select Root Desire:
○ Vishaya (Sensory pleasure)
○ Bhoga (Comfort/enjoyment)  
● Kirti (Recognition/validation)
○ Aishvarya (Power/control)
○ Iccha (Craving/thirst)
```

#### Phase 2: Chain Building
```
BUILD SKILLFUL PATH:
1. NEW OBSERVATION: What could you notice instead?
   [User writes their reframe]

2. NEW FEELING: How do you want to feel?
   [User chooses desired emotion]
   
3. NEW ACTION: What will you actually do?
   [User commits to specific task]
```

#### Phase 3: Practice & Crystallization
- Complete new task = damage to Kama
- Repeat 5 times = create Totem (permanent wisdom)
- Totems provide quick reference during future battles

### Design Philosophy
- **No content generation**: All solutions from player
- **Practice over theory**: Victory requires real action
- **Personal library**: Your solutions become references
- **Reality bridge**: Game mechanics drive real behavior change
```

## Example 2: Life HUD's Zone-Based NUT Offering System

### User Request:
"Create an exploration mechanic where users discover places to store their NUTs"

### Agent Response:

```markdown
## Kingdom Navigation & NUT Offering

### Core Mechanic: Explore → Discover → Offer → Store
Like Pokemon's region exploration but for consciousness mapping

### Zone Discovery System
```
         SPIRIT KINGDOM
          🔒 (10 NUTs)
              ╱ ╲
           ╱     ╲
    MIND KINGDOM   BODY KINGDOM
      [Enter ▶]      [Enter ▶]
         ╲       ╱
          ╲   ╱
       YOU ARE HERE
```

### NUT Offering Gameplay Loop

#### Phase 1: Capture with NUT Bar
```
[+] What's happening?                [N][U][T]
```
NUT enters inventory as unassigned resource

#### Phase 2: Zone Recognition
Navigate to /body/actions/muscles:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│    The Training Grounds sense your      │
│    physical experience!                 │
│                                        │
│    💪 "Did 3 sets of curls"            │
│                                        │
│    Offer this NUT to strengthen        │
│    this zone?                          │
│                                        │
│    [Keep in Inventory] [Offer →]       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Phase 3: Zone Health Feedback
```
Zone Health: ████████░░ 80% (+10%)
Recent Offerings: 12 NUTs
Relationship: Trusted
```

### Unlock Requirements (Pokemon-style)
- **Early**: Body/Mind unlocked from start
- **Mid**: Specific actions unlock deeper zones
  - Log meal → unlock /body/senses/taste
  - Log workout → unlock /body/actions/muscles
- **Late**: Spirit Kingdom needs 10 total NUTs
- **Special**: Easter eggs and guild-specific zones

### Design Principles
- **Visible but blocked**: See locked zones to create anticipation
- **Multiple paths**: Non-linear progression
- **Mechanical engagement**: Progress through system usage
- **Zone relationships**: Regular offerings = zone benefits
```

## Example 3: Lilaya's Guild System Design

### User Request:
"Design a class/guild system based on the three gunas from yogic philosophy"

### Agent Response:

```markdown
## Three Guilds: Gunas as Gameplay Classes

### Guild Mechanics Based on Universal Forces

#### Law Guild (Tamas - Stability)
**Defensive Playstyle**: Structure and crystallization
```
ABILITIES:
- Crystallize Pattern: Lock beneficial habits in place
- Stone Wall: Resist emotional turbulence
- Archive Wisdom: Permanent knowledge storage
- Fortress Mode: Total defense during crisis

STATS FOCUS:

STATS FOCUS:

```

### Guild Interaction Mechanics
- **Elemental Triangle**: Law > Commerce > Media > Law
- **Dual-classing**: Combine two guilds for hybrid builds
- **Guild Quests**: Specialized challenges per guild
- **Resource Trading**: Guilds generate different resources
```

## Example 4: ADHD-Optimized Crisis Mode

### User Request:
"The user is overwhelmed and can't handle complex UI. Design a panic button mode."

### Agent Response:

```markdown
## Crisis Mode: Survival Over Optimization

### Activation: Triple-tap anywhere or "Help" button

### Interface Transformation
```
NORMAL MODE → CRISIS MODE

Complex UI with         Giant buttons with
multiple options   →    single actions

┌─────────────┐         ┌─────────────┐
│ Tags: [...] │         │             │
│ Zone: [...] │    →    │  [CAPTURE]  │
│ Type: [...] │         │   (huge)    │
│ Time: [...] │         │             │
└─────────────┘         └─────────────┘
```

### Crisis Actions (One-Tap Each)
```
┌──────────────────────────┐
│                          │
│    😰 OVERWHELMED        │
│                          │
│    [BREATHE]             │
│    [DUMP THOUGHTS]       │
│    [MARK CRISIS]         │
│    [EXIT APP]            │
│                          │
│    No judgment.          │
│    Just survival.        │
└──────────────────────────┘
```

### Design Principles
- **Assume chaos**: User can't think clearly
- **Reduce to binary**: Yes/No, Do/Don't
- **Visual over text**: Icons and colors
- **Instant escape**: Close without saving is OK
- **Gap acknowledgment**: "Crisis happened here ❤️"

### Post-Crisis Recovery
When user returns:
```
Welcome back. You had a crisis 2 hours ago.
That's okay. Here's what happened:
[Summary of crisis period]
[Continue] [Mark as recovered]
```

No streaks broken, no shame, just acknowledgment.
```

## Example 5: Totem Formation Without AI

### User Request:
"Players should create their own patterns, not have AI detect them"

### Agent Response:

```markdown
## Manual Totem Crafting System

### Player-Controlled Pattern Creation

#### Collection Phase
Player manually selects related NUTs:
```
YOUR INVENTORY:
□ "Went to gym" (Task)
□ "Feeling energized" (Urge)
☑ "Protein shake" (Note)
☑ "Leg day complete" (Task)
☑ "Stronger than yesterday" (Note)

[Chain Selected NUTs →]
```

#### Intention Setting
Player defines the pattern meaning:
```
TOTEM CREATION RITUAL

You selected 3 NUTs. 
What pattern do they represent?

Name: [Strength Training]
Type: ○ Habit ● Insight ○ Victory
Intent: [Building physical power]

Required Components:
✓ Form (from Body Kingdom)
✗ Intent (from Mind Kingdom) 
✗ Binding (from Spirit Kingdom)

[Gather Components] [Save Draft]
```

#### Sealing Ritual
After gathering components:
```
SEAL YOUR TOTEM

Pattern: Strength Training
Components: ✓ Form ✓ Intent ✓ Binding

This totem will:
- Grant +2 STR when activated
- Require weekly maintenance
- Decay if not practiced

[Perform Sealing] [Cancel]
```

### Design Philosophy
- **No pattern detection**: Player decides connections
- **Meaningful choice**: Components from different kingdoms
- **Maintenance required**: Totems need practice to persist
- **Personal meaning**: Player's interpretation is canon
```

## Test Case Validation

### Consistency Check
Given the prompt "Design a meditation app", the agent should:
✅ Create breath as resource mechanic
✅ Sessions as dungeon runs
✅ Thoughts as enemy waves
✅ Mantras as spells
❌ NOT suggest points/badges
❌ NOT add social features during struggle

### Mechanical Depth Check
Given "Add depth to a todo list", the agent should:
✅ Task types with elemental weaknesses
✅ Time-of-day power multipliers
✅ Combo system for task chains
✅ Energy resource management
❌ NOT just add XP bars

### ADHD Accommodation Check
Given "User keeps breaking streaks", the agent should:
✅ Container filling (partial progress counts)
✅ "Life happened" gap acknowledgment
✅ Crisis mode with huge buttons
✅ No shame mechanics
❌ NOT suggest notifications
❌ NOT add morning check-ins

### Player Agency Check
Given "Help users build better habits", the agent should:
✅ Manual pattern identification
✅ Player-created solutions
✅ Self-selected meaning
✅ Custom totem creation
❌ NOT auto-detect patterns
❌ NOT generate content for user
