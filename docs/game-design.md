# Life HUD as Modular NUT Journaling Mind Palace - Game Design

## Core Concept Evolution
Transform the hierarchical system into a modular journaling platform where exploration unlocks tagging zones for NUT entries. Players build their personalized mind palace through discovery and guild customization.

## Modular Journaling System

### Zone-Based Logging
Each area of the mind palace becomes a specialized logging module:

#### Body Zones (Physical Logging)
- **`/body/actions/muscles/bicep`** → Log bicep workouts directly
- **`/body/senses/taste`** → Log meals and flavor experiences
- **`/body/actions/locomotion`** → Log walks, runs, movement patterns
- Each zone has specialized input fields relevant to that activity

### Universal NUT Tagging
Similar to Toggl's time tracking but for life awareness:

1. **Quick Capture**: Log any NUT with timestamp
2. **Tag Discovery**: Explore zones to unlock their tags
3. **Multi-tagging**: One NUT can belong to multiple zones
4. **Retroactive Tagging**: Can add tags to past entries as you discover zones

Example flow:
```
User logs: "Did 3 sets of curls" [Task]
Tags available: #bicep #muscles #strength
Timestamp: Auto-captured
Location: Stored in /body/actions/muscles/bicep
```

## Exploration & Unlocking System

### Progressive Discovery
1. **Start with Basic Zones**: Body, Mind, Spirit (locked)
2. **Explore to Unlock**: Navigate to new areas to make them available for tagging
3. **Zone Benefits**: Each unlocked zone provides:
   - New tags for NUT entries
   - Specialized input templates
   - Zone-specific analytics
   - Custom CBT exercises

### Discovery Mechanics
- **Fog of War**: Unexplored areas shown as greyed out
- **Requirements**: Some zones need prerequisites (e.g., log 10 body NUTs to unlock deeper body zones)
- **Achievements**: Unlock special zones through consistent practice

#### Example Unlock Requirements

**Early Unlocks (Tutorial Flow):**
- Body/Senses → Unlocked from start
- Body/Actions → Unlocked from start  
- Mind/Thoughts → Unlocked from start
- Mind/Feelings → Unlock after 3 NUTs

**Mid-Game Unlocks:**
- Body/Senses/Taste → Log 1 meal or drink
- Body/Actions/Muscles → Log 1 workout or physical task
- Mind/Thoughts/Observations → Log 5 notes
- Mind/Feelings/Complex → Experience 3 different primary emotions

**Late-Game Unlocks:**
- Spirit Kingdom → 10 total NUTs OR 7-day streak OR complete onboarding
- Body/Actions/Reproduction → Age gate + 20 body NUTs
- Mind/Thoughts/Memories → 10 notes + identify 1 pattern
- Spirit/Purpose → Complete self-reflection quest

**Special Unlocks:**
- Secret zones via easter eggs
- Guild-specific zones when joining a guild
- Seasonal zones during events

## Guild System (Life Role Encapsulation)

### Spirit Layer Functions
The `/spirit/` directory becomes the meta-game layer:

#### Core Spirit Features
1. **Personal Values** (`/spirit/purpose/values`)
   - Define what matters to you
   - Align NUTs with values
   - Value-based scoring system

2. **Direction & Goals** (`/spirit/purpose/goals`)
   - Set long-term objectives
   - Map NUT patterns to goals
   - Progress tracking

3. **Sadhana (Practice)** (`/spirit/practices`)
   - Daily rituals and routines
   - Habit formation tracking
   - Consistency rewards

4. **Stats Configuration** (`/spirit/connection/self`)
   - Customize which attributes matter
   - Personal stat weights
   - Progress metrics

### Guild Concept
A guild represents a cohesive life role or identity that encapsulates:
1. **Stat Tree**: Hierarchical tags tracking attributes/skills relevant to that role
2. **Rituals**: Recurring tasks/practices that maintain and develop that role
3. **Campaigns**: Time tracking for activities related to that role

This aligns with Vedantic/Samkhya yogic philosophy - each guild is like a dharma or life path we embody.

### Guild Establishment
Guilds are life roles players create or clone:

#### Guild Types (Examples)
1. **Warrior Guild**
   - Focus: Physical strength, discipline
   - Custom tags: #training #combat #endurance
   - Stat priorities: Strength, Constitution, Will
   - Special zones: Training grounds, Arena

2. **Scholar Guild**
   - Focus: Learning, analysis, wisdom
   - Custom tags: #study #research #insight
   - Stat priorities: Intelligence, Focus, Memory
   - Special zones: Library, Laboratory

3. **Artist Guild**
   - Focus: Creativity, expression, flow
   - Custom tags: #create #inspire #flow
   - Stat priorities: Creativity, Perception, Emotion
   - Special zones: Studio, Gallery

#### Guild Mechanics
```javascript
interface Guild {
  name: string;
  tagTree: TagHierarchy;  // Custom tag structure
  statPriorities: StatWeight[];
  specialZones: Zone[];
  abilities: GuildAbility[];
  progression: LevelSystem;
}

// Players can:
// - Create guilds from scratch
// - Clone and modify existing guilds
// - Share guilds with others
// - Multi-class (belong to multiple guilds)
```

## Kingdom Navigation Design

### Three Kingdoms Structure (from Lilaya lore)
Based on the yogic philosophy layers from the Samsara kingdom:

1. **Outer Kingdom** (`/body`) - Physical interface with world
   - Represents action and sensory experience (Tamas/stability)
   - Where orders are carried out and resources gathered
   - Home to farmers, soldiers, laborers

2. **Middle Kingdom** (`/mind`) - Thoughts and feelings  
   - Represents thought and feeling processes (Rajas/energy)
   - Where decisions are implemented through systems
   - Home to merchants, craftspeople, administrators

3. **Inner Kingdom** (`/spirit`) - Pure awareness [LOCKED]
   - Center of awareness and decision-making (Sattva/clarity)
   - Where policy and high-level decisions are made
   - Home to royalty, scholars, spiritual leaders

### Navigation Philosophy
- **Simple page-to-page movement** like Persona or dating sims
- Each page is a **location in the kingdom** you visit
- **Index page = Kingdom Gates/Overview** - Where you choose which kingdom to enter
- **Breadcrumbs = Your path** through the palace
- **/sitemap** = Full development map (moved from index)

### Game Loop
1. **Start at Kingdom Gates** (index) - See three kingdoms' health/activity
2. **Enter a Kingdom** - Navigate to /body, /mind, or /spirit
3. **Explore Locations** - Each subpage is a room/area to visit
4. **Capture NUTs** - Using expandable journal/inventory panel
5. **Build Experience** - NUTs get stored in current location
6. **Unlock Deeper Areas** - Through consistent practice

### Exploration & Progression Design (Pokemon-inspired)

#### Visible but Blocked
Like Pokemon's Indigo Plateau or sleeping Snorlax, players can SEE locked areas but need to meet requirements:

- **Spirit Kingdom** visible from start but requires "10 NUTs" (like needing 8 badges)
- **Body/Actions/Reproduction** visible but needs "maturity level" or specific unlock
- **Mind/Thoughts/Memories** visible but needs "5 observation NUTs" first
- Each locked zone shows:
  - What it contains (preview/description)
  - Why it's locked (requirement)
  - Progress toward unlock (3/10 NUTs)

#### Non-Linear Progression
Unlike Pokemon's strict gym order, multiple paths available:

- Can start with Body OR Mind exploration
- Within Body, can focus on Senses OR Actions
- Some zones have multiple unlock paths:
  - Spirit unlocks via: 10 total NUTs OR complete a 7-day streak OR finish tutorial quest
  - Advanced zones unlock via: quantity (10 NUTs) OR quality (identify 3 patterns) OR time (3 days active)

#### Mechanical Engagement Creates Progress
Progression comes from using the system, not grinding:

- **Logging NUTs** = Experience points
- **Identifying patterns** = Skill development  
- **Maintaining streaks** = Discipline training
- **Exploring zones** = Map discovery
- **Reacting to NUTs** = Emotional intelligence
- **Tagging correctly** = Organizational mastery

#### Teasing Future Content
Show glimpses of what's coming:

- Locked zones display grayed-out preview: "🔒 Inner Sanctum - Where purpose aligns with action"
- Hovering shows requirements: "Unlock by reaching Middle Kingdom first"
- NPCs/Hints reference locked areas: "I heard the Spirit Temple has powerful meditation techniques..."
- Partial visibility: Can see zone name and icon but not enter

### NUT Capture Panel (Inventory System)
Expandable panel like Toggl Track that slides up from bottom:

**Collapsed State:**
- Minimal bar with quick capture input
- Type selector (Note/Urge/Task)
- Expand button

**Expanded State (MTG Card-like):**
- Full capture form with rich fields
- Time adjustment
- Tag selection (based on unlocked zones)
- Zone assignment (where to store the NUT)
- Recurrence settings
- Quick reactions/mood
- Preview of how NUT will appear

Always accessible while navigating the kingdom, like carrying a journal.

## Implementation Architecture

### Data Structure
```javascript
// Core NUT with zone storage
interface NUT {
  id: string;

4. **Zone Health**: Visual feedback on life balance
5. **Reality Bridge**: Seamless blend of journaling and gaming

## Lilaya Core Integration

### NUT System Foundation
The NUT (Note/Urge/Task) system remains the core:
- **Notes**: Observations and thoughts manifest in Mind zones
- **Urges**: Emotions and desires appear in Feeling zones
- **Tasks**: Actions populate Body/Action zones

### Reality Bridge Mechanics
- Players log real-life experiences
- These manifest as resources in their mind palace
- Characters in the game world see them as natural phenomena
- Only the player understands the connection

### CBT Combat System
Each NUT type requires different purification strategies:
- **Note Battles**: Cognitive restructuring in thought chambers
- **Urge Battles**: Emotion regulation in feeling halls
- **Task Battles**: Behavioral activation in action zones

### Kama Corruption
- Distorted desires taint incoming NUTs
- Corruption spreads between connected zones
- Players must identify and purify before kingdom chaos
- Pattern recognition reveals corruption sources

This design maintains Lilaya's core NUT philosophy while adding exploration, customization, and progression layers that make journaling feel like adventure.
