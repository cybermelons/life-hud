# Lilaya Game Design - Krishna's Guidance

## The Dharmic Architecture

The three kingdoms mirror the Trigunas from Samkhya philosophy:
- **Body Kingdom (Tamas)** - Stability, inertia, material realm
- **Mind Kingdom (Rajas)** - Energy, passion, transformation  
- **Spirit Kingdom (Sattva)** - Clarity, wisdom, transcendence

## Urge-to-Task Mapping (Klesha to Karma Yoga)

Transform destructive urges (kleshas) into skillful actions through the game mechanics:

### The Five Primary Kleshas and Their Remedies

**1. Kama (Lust/Desire) → Bhakti Tasks**
- Urge Example: "I want attention/validation"
- Skillful Task: "Serve someone anonymously today"
- Storage Zone: Body/Actions/Service
- Purification: Transform selfish desire into devotional service

**2. Krodha (Anger) → Tapas Tasks**  
- Urge Example: "I'm furious at this person"
- Skillful Task: "10 minute intense workout" or "Cold shower meditation"
- Storage Zone: Body/Actions/Discipline
- Purification: Transform rage into disciplined energy

**3. Lobha (Greed) → Dana Tasks**
- Urge Example: "I need more money/things"
- Skillful Task: "Give something away" or "Practice gratitude journaling"
- Storage Zone: Spirit/Practices/Generosity
- Purification: Transform grasping into generous flow

**4. Moha (Delusion) → Jnana Tasks**
- Urge Example: "Everything is meaningless"
- Skillful Task: "Study wisdom text" or "Reflect on impermanence"
- Storage Zone: Mind/Thoughts/Wisdom
- Purification: Transform confusion into clarity

**5. Mada (Pride) → Seva Tasks**
- Urge Example: "I'm better than others"
- Skillful Task: "Help someone succeed" or "Learn from someone younger"
- Storage Zone: Spirit/Connection/Humility
- Purification: Transform ego into service

## Campaign System - Life Dharmas

Guilds: guilds represent dharma (life role) with specific practices and progressions.
Guilds can run campaigns to set an intent and create a consistency goal.
The point of campaigns is to help prioritize in life. Players can have many campaigns,
but may select only a few to actively work on.

### WIP: Core Guild Types

these are tentative guild types. possibly used to determine movesets/stats/equips.
the other optionis to do gunas-affinity (see gunas docs).

**Kshatriya Campaign** (Warrior/Protector)
- Primary Stats: Discipline, Courage, Strength
- Daily Rituals: Physical training, boundary setting, protection practices
- Transformation Focus: Anger → Protective strength
- Unlocks: Combat zones, discipline totems, warrior guild features

**Brahmana Campaign** (Teacher/Scholar)
- Primary Stats: Wisdom, Knowledge, Clarity
- Daily Rituals: Study, teaching, contemplation, meditation
- Transformation Focus: Confusion → Clarity
- Unlocks: Library zones, wisdom totems, scholar guild features

**Vaishya Campaign** (Creator/Provider)
- Primary Stats: Prosperity, Creativity, Abundance
- Daily Rituals: Work excellence, value creation, abundance practices
- Transformation Focus: Greed → Generosity
- Unlocks: Marketplace zones, prosperity totems, merchant guild features

**Shudra Campaign** (Server/Supporter)
- Primary Stats: Devotion, Compassion, Service
- Daily Rituals: Service acts, care-giving, community building
- Transformation Focus: Pride → Humility
- Unlocks: Temple zones, devotion totems, service guild features

### Campaign Mechanics

1. **Selection**: Player chooses active campaign(s) at Spirit/Purpose
2. **Time Tracking**: Like Toggl, but for life roles
3. **Ritual Completion**: Daily practices maintain campaign progress
4. **Role Switching**: Can pause one dharma to focus on another
5. **Multi-Classing**: Advanced players can run parallel campaigns

## Tentative: NPC Design as Consciousness Aspects

Possible ideas. unused at the moment.

NPCs represent aspects of consciousness that guide, challenge, and teach:

## The Sacred Game Loop

### 1. Samsara Phase (Capture)
- Log the endless cycle of thoughts/feelings/actions
- No judgment, just witnessing
- Creates raw NUT inventory

### 2. Viveka Phase (Discrimination)
- Identify helpful vs harmful NUTs
- Recognize kleshas (afflictions)
- Sort into appropriate categories

### 3. Vairagya Phase (Detachment)
- Practice non-attachment by offering NUTs to zones
- Let go of outcomes
- Trust the process

### 4. Sadhana Phase (Practice)
- Transform negative patterns through prescribed tasks
- Complete rituals and campaigns
- Build positive habit totems

### 5. Moksha Moments (Liberation)
- Brief glimpses of freedom when patterns break
- Temporary stat boosts
- Unlock hidden zones

## Karma Yoga Implementation

### The Right to Action, Not Results

Following the Bhagavad Gita 2.47:
- Players log actions without attachment to outcomes
- No immediate rewards for "good" NUTs
- Delayed feedback through zone health
- Focus on the practice, not the prize

### Corruption as Teaching Tool

- Untended kleshas spread through connected zones
- Visual decay shows impact of neglected emotions
- Forces player attention to problem areas
- Purification becomes necessary, not optional
- Mobs spawn if untreated

### Totem Formation as Samskaras

- Repeated actions create lasting impressions (samskaras)
- Manual totem creation = conscious habit formation
- Totems decay without maintenance = habits need reinforcement
- Multiple totems can combine into powerful traits

## Progressive Revelation

### Early Game: Karma Collection
- Simple logging without understanding
- Discovering basic zones

### Mid Game: Dharma Recognition
- Understanding patterns and roles
- Choosing campaigns and guilds
- Learning purification techniques

### Late Game: Moksha Glimpses
- Mastery of transformation techniques
- Creating custom practices
- Teaching others through shared guilds

## Integration with Existing Design

This framework enhances the current system by:
1. Adding philosophical depth to the NUT system
2. Creating meaningful campaign objectives
3. Providing clear transformation paths for negative emotions
4. Turning the game into a practice of self-realization

The game becomes a modern implementation of ancient wisdom, using technology to make visible the invisible processes of consciousness and transformation.

## Key Teachings Embedded

1. **You are not your thoughts** - NUTs are objects to observe
2. **Action without attachment** - Log without expecting rewards
3. **Everything is connected** - Zone corruption shows interconnection
4. **Practice makes permanent** - Totems require maintenance

This is dharma-fication: making the eternal battle between light and darkness within each soul into an engaging, educational, and ultimately liberating experience.
